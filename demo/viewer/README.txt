Comments:

Scene lighting has strange artifact. I could not find the cause for this.
It appears this artifact is triggered just be flipping the value of
scene_lighting. However, even if scene_lighting is not used at all, it is
still triggered.

Extra Controls:
* l to toggle scene lighting
* mouse wheel up/down to zoom in/out
